        "content": "Attention, @everyone {added marginTop}\n======================\n\n* **Usernames are evolving.** Over the coming weeks, we will be inviting everyone on Discord (yep, even you) to update to a new username format that will be easier to remember and share with friends. Instead of having a discriminator (the #0001 number), usernames will be entirely unique. You can keep your display name as it is today or choose a wild and crazy one to better express yourself. When it’s your turn to update, we’ll let you know. [Learn more about this change.](https://discord.com/blog/usernames)\n\n\nFor our superfans {progress}\n======================\n\n* **Wumpus Wonderventures Webtoon.** Say that three times fast. To celebrate our awesome fans, we made a webcomic featuring Wumpus and other Discord friends on an adventure. For a limited time, as a reward for your wholesome obsession with Wumpus, you can find and redeem a free 1-month Nitro code (some restrictions apply). Read Wumpus Wonderventures today on [Webtoon](https://go.webtoons.com/1fy0Nzqoxzb).\n* **Discord’s 8th birthday afterparty continues.** In case you missed it: new drops in the [merch store](https://discordmerch.com/dxclog): the *DISXCORE* collection, Elgato stream kits, plushies, just tons of cute stuff.\n\n\nIn other news: Sounds? Good. {improved}\n======================\n\n* **Say more with voice messages.** These were a hit in DMs and small servers, so we are adding them to larger servers. Admins who love silence can [turn this off](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/13091096725527-Voice-Messages-#h_01GY0QJKCN13FJ6QXWXS6HD8BV) if they wish.\n* **Sound off with soundboard.** Make your voice hangout a little more interesting with duck quacks, throat singing, the Vine boom, or any [sounds curated by your community](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12612888127767-Soundboard-FAQ). Please airhorn responsibly.\n* **Stickers by Discord are now free for all.** Our Wumpus, Mallow, and Choco sticker sets will soon be available to everyone.\n* **New members get a warmer welcome.** Community managers, you can now set up a simple quiz for new members to automatically assign channels and roles. People who join your Capybara Cleanliness Club server will spend less time figuring out how to get perms, and more time admiring pics of a capybara taking a hot bath. So cute…anyway, check out the [blog](https://discord.com/community/community-onboarding) to learn more.\n* **Embedded channel links now look like embedded channel links.** If you’ve ever copied the permalink to a channel or message (half of you reading can probably skip this at this point) and shared it, it probably wasn’t exactly exciting to see a long link with no context about where it was from. We made it so now you know where it takes you.\n\n",

        "content": "Discord turns 9 this May! And birthdays mean presents… but for YOU. 🫵 \n\nOver the next nine days, we’ll be giving away one-of-a-kind prizes and stuff that makes gaming with your friends on Discord way more fun. Keep an eye out on our social media accounts such as X ([US](https://twitter.com/discord), [Japan](https://twitter.com/discord_JP), [France](https://twitter.com/discord_FR)) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/discord/)!\n\nWe also brought you gifts *right here, right now* in the form of new ways to spend time with your friends and bug fixes to make that time as frictionless as possible. Read on to see what’s new! \n\nMore Fun, During and After The Call {improved}\n===============\n\n- **You can now play an Activity within text channels in servers.** If you’re not feeling like being in Voice but still want to get a few rounds of Blazing 8s in with your friends, we’ve got you covered. Desktop users can use the “+” button in text channels, and mobile peeps can press the shiny new button that we’re about to shout out below (get ready for it):   \n- **Access Apps on mobile with an all-new <:shapes:1184226211199733892> App Launcher.** It’s your one-stop-shop for all your Apps and Activities, right on your mobile chat bar. Easily use App commands with taps instead of typing — no need to worry about which shape goes in the square hole. [Learn more here](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/21334461140375-Using-Apps-on-Discord).\n- **Ask what @everyone thinks with Polls.** Use Polls to decide what to play, ask your burning and benign questions, or decide if you should chomp an entire jalapeno in one bite! Use the previously-mentioned “+” button to create Polls. +1 to the Plus Button.\n- **On desktop, pop-up profiles now display someone’s mutual servers and friends.** Now it’s just a single click to see which mutuals you share with someone, helping make new connections easier. Also helpful for determining which server someone’s asking for mod help in. \n\nMore Fixes, Less Crashes {improved}\n===============\n\n- **Bluetooth devices now connect properly when you join a call.** Previously, if you joined a call and turned on your Bluetooth headphones, your call wouldn't swap to your newly connected device properly. This now just works, meaning less talking into a device that wasn’t even working. \n- **Permission to Poll: Granted.** Tons of work goes into managing servers. It’s important to have the right tools—and permissions—to do so. Creating Polls in servers is now tied to a new “Create Polls” permission. Save it for just moderators, or let everyone use ‘em!\n- **Mobile is better at not using battery when it doesn’t need to.** Mobile now knows to conserve resources when the app isn’t detecting anyone talking or you’re deafened in a Voice call, letting the app save on battery. Rejoice, VC sleepers! \n- **Crashes are a bummer. Android does that less now.** Our expert dev team resolved a few long-standing Android crashes that were particularly tricky to track down. These fixes reduced the platform's crash rate by over a third — 37% to be precise! */adjusts glasses*\n\nP.S. If you love reading about stuff like Electron updates, unicode rendering fixes, and tangible reductions in crash rates shown in percentages, you’re in luck: our Engineering team has collected the latest technical fixes to show how they’re always making Discord better. \n\nCheck out their Patch Notes [here](https://dis.gd/patch-notes-april-2024)!\n\n",

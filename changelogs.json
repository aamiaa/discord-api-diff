        "content": "Attention, @everyone {added marginTop}\n======================\n\n* **Usernames are evolving.** Over the coming weeks, we will be inviting everyone on Discord (yep, even you) to update to a new username format that will be easier to remember and share with friends. Instead of having a discriminator (the #0001 number), usernames will be entirely unique. You can keep your display name as it is today or choose a wild and crazy one to better express yourself. When it‚Äôs your turn to update, we‚Äôll let you know. [Learn more about this change.](https://discord.com/blog/usernames)\n\n\nFor our superfans {progress}\n======================\n\n* **Wumpus Wonderventures Webtoon.** Say that three times fast. To celebrate our awesome fans, we made a webcomic featuring Wumpus and other Discord friends on an adventure. For a limited time, as a reward for your wholesome obsession with Wumpus, you can find and redeem a free 1-month Nitro code (some restrictions apply). Read Wumpus Wonderventures today on [Webtoon](https://go.webtoons.com/1fy0Nzqoxzb).\n* **Discord‚Äôs 8th birthday afterparty continues.** In case you missed it: new drops in the [merch store](https://discordmerch.com/dxclog): the *DISXCORE* collection, Elgato stream kits, plushies, just tons of cute stuff.\n\n\nIn other news: Sounds? Good. {improved}\n======================\n\n* **Say more with voice messages.** These were a hit in DMs and small servers, so we are adding them to larger servers. Admins who love silence can [turn this off](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/13091096725527-Voice-Messages-#h_01GY0QJKCN13FJ6QXWXS6HD8BV) if they wish.\n* **Sound off with soundboard.** Make your voice hangout a little more interesting with duck quacks, throat singing, the Vine boom, or any [sounds curated by your community](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12612888127767-Soundboard-FAQ). Please airhorn responsibly.\n* **Stickers by Discord are now free for all.** Our Wumpus, Mallow, and Choco sticker sets will soon be available to everyone.\n* **New members get a warmer welcome.** Community managers, you can now set up a simple quiz for new members to automatically assign channels and roles. People who join your Capybara Cleanliness Club server will spend less time figuring out how to get perms, and more time admiring pics of a capybara taking a hot bath. So cute‚Ä¶anyway, check out the [blog](https://discord.com/community/community-onboarding) to learn more.\n* **Embedded channel links now look like embedded channel links.** If you‚Äôve ever copied the permalink to a channel or message (half of you reading can probably skip this at this point) and shared it, it probably wasn‚Äôt exactly exciting to see a long link with no context about where it was from. We made it so now you know where it takes you.\n\n",

        "content": "Discord turns 9 this May! And birthdays mean presents‚Ä¶ but for YOU. ü´µ \n\nOver the next nine days, we‚Äôll be giving away one-of-a-kind prizes and stuff that makes gaming with your friends on Discord way more fun. Keep an eye out on our social media accounts such as X ([US](https://twitter.com/discord), [Japan](https://twitter.com/discord_JP), [France](https://twitter.com/discord_FR)) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/discord/)!\n\nWe also brought you gifts *right here, right now* in the form of new ways to spend time with your friends and bug fixes to make that time as frictionless as possible. Read on to see what‚Äôs new! \n\nMore Fun, During and After The Call {improved}\n===============\n\n- **You can now play an Activity within text channels in servers.** If you‚Äôre not feeling like being in Voice but still want to get a few rounds of Blazing 8s in with your friends, we‚Äôve got you covered. Desktop users can use the ‚Äú+‚Äù button in text channels, and mobile peeps can press the shiny new button that we‚Äôre about to shout out below (get ready for it):   \n- **Access Apps on mobile with an all-new <:shapes:1184226211199733892> App Launcher.** It‚Äôs your one-stop-shop for all your Apps and Activities, right on your mobile chat bar. Easily use App commands with taps instead of typing ‚Äî no need to worry about which shape goes in the square hole. [Learn more here](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/21334461140375-Using-Apps-on-Discord).\n- **Ask what @everyone thinks with Polls.** Use Polls to decide what to play, ask your burning and benign questions, or decide if you should chomp an entire jalapeno in one bite! Use the previously-mentioned ‚Äú+‚Äù button to create Polls. +1 to the Plus Button.\n- **On desktop, pop-up profiles now display someone‚Äôs mutual servers and friends.** Now it‚Äôs just a single click to see which mutuals you share with someone, helping make new connections easier. Also helpful for determining which server someone‚Äôs asking for mod help in. \n\nMore Fixes, Less Crashes {improved}\n===============\n\n- **Bluetooth devices now connect properly when you join a call.** Previously, if you joined a call and turned on your Bluetooth headphones, your call wouldn't swap to your newly connected device properly. This now just works, meaning less talking into a device that wasn‚Äôt even working. \n- **Permission to Poll: Granted.** Tons of work goes into managing servers. It‚Äôs important to have the right tools‚Äîand permissions‚Äîto do so. Creating Polls in servers is now tied to a new ‚ÄúCreate Polls‚Äù permission. Save it for just moderators, or let everyone use ‚Äòem!\n- **Mobile is better at not using battery when it doesn‚Äôt need to.** Mobile now knows to conserve resources when the app isn‚Äôt detecting anyone talking or you‚Äôre deafened in a Voice call, letting the app save on battery. Rejoice, VC sleepers! \n- **Crashes are a bummer. Android does that less now.** Our expert dev team resolved a few long-standing Android crashes that were particularly tricky to track down. These fixes reduced the platform's crash rate by over a third ‚Äî 37% to be precise! */adjusts glasses*\n\nP.S. If you love reading about stuff like Electron updates, unicode rendering fixes, and tangible reductions in crash rates shown in percentages, you‚Äôre in luck: our Engineering team has collected the latest technical fixes to show how they‚Äôre always making Discord better. \n\nCheck out their Patch Notes [here](https://dis.gd/patch-notes-april-2024)!\n\n",

Both get new customization options to let you make Discord work best for you, whether you‚Äôre streaming to show everyone how delicious the cheese naan looks in Monster Hunter or you‚Äôre just talkin‚Äô in voice all day.\n\nAn overhaul for the Overlay‚Ä¶ {improved}\n================\n\n- **More customizable.** The in-game Overlay is now made up of separate widgets that you can move around and organize your way, to better fit the type of games you‚Äôre into. RTS? FPS? Hello Kitty: Island Adventure (yes it‚Äôs good)? Adapt the Overlay to your needs. \n- **More functional.** Watch someone‚Äôs stream directly from the Overlay. Share your own gameplay in the voice chat you‚Äôre in with a single click. And if you‚Äôre used to spamming in-game emotes or sprays, using the Soundboard directly from the Overlay will feel juuust like home. \n- **More games supported‚Ä¶-able.** Even with [these new features](http://dis.gd/OverlayDesktopBlogCL), the Overlay works with waaay more games! Quickly glance at your newest Discord notifications while playing even more of your favorite releases. \n\n‚Ä¶a freshened-up look for desktop‚Ä¶ {added marginTop}\n================\n\n- **Tweak the desktop app to fit your needs.** Use one of our new base themes (Light, Ash, Dark, Onyx), or choose between three new UI density options to adjust app spacing. We also scooted the Inbox up into the title bar, giving more space to your chats, calls, and other shenanigans. \n- **They‚Äôre all easy buttons to button.** For voice and video calls, more buttons are centralized into a single bar instead of being split into tiny lil‚Äô islands. The camera button now stays green when your camera‚Äôs in use, in case you forgot that you hid your own video preview during calls. Again.\n- **Plus, the channel list is now resizable**, perfect for reading channels with longer names like #üí¨-general-discussion-memes-are-banned-here, so you can proudly post memes in there ‚Äî just as the mods intended.

See how it works [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/27893392334359-In-game-Features-Powered-by-Discord-FAQ).\n- **A new Ignore option helps you step away from a conversation** by [hiding someone‚Äôs messages in DMs, group chats, and servers](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/28084948873623). Ignored users don‚Äôt see any indication that you‚Äôve ignored them, and you can easily talk to them again if you decide you‚Äôve had enough breathing room.\n- **Card-collecting conquerors, check out ‚ÄúSpark: Hero Tactics,‚Äù** Discord‚Äôs new grid-based, deck-building battler. Summon creatures, sling spells, and destroy your opponent‚Äôs fortress to claim victory.

Let‚Äôs Switch to Fixes {improved}\n================\n\n- [**In April**](https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-april-3-2025#1)**, we upgraded the Quick Switcher,** making it more likely to show the channel or DM you‚Äôre actually trying to get to. If you *don‚Äôt* use Quick Switcher and love talking in LOTS of servers, [try it out sometime](https://discord.com/blog/how-to-use-keyboard-shortcuts-on-discord-create-custom-keybinds#5)\\! You‚Äôll start getting to convos faster than you can think of their \\#channel-names.   \n- [**In May**](https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-may-1-2025#1)**, we added Markdown syntax for email addresses**. Putting an email between brackets `<like this>` will let others quickly send an email by just clicking on it. If you‚Äôre still one of those ‚Äúemail‚Äù users‚Ä¶ you *do* know Discord‚Äôs *right here*, right?   \n- [**In June**](https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-june-3-2025#1)**, mobile image embeds received a nice quality bump** by changing how our mobile app handles image compression. Embeds made from lower-quality images will look MUCH better, and *all* images from mobile will upload and render a little bit faster. \n\nUpgrade Your Community and Your Profile {improved}\n================\n\n- **Put your extra Server Boosts to work** by using them to [unlock new features](https://discord.com/blog/get-more-from-your-boosts-with-new-server-perks)! Along with Server Tags mentioned at the beginning, Enhanced Role Styles will help give your server‚Äôs roles glowing gradients. Ooooh, shiiiiny.   \n- **Keep your pile of Quest Avatar Decorations longer.** Nitro members can use many of the past (and upcoming) [Quest-earned Avatar Decorations](https://discord.com/blog/nitro-members-keep-quest-rewards-longer) looong after their two-month time limit, letting you always show off that being a Shadow the Hedgehog fan wasn‚Äôt just a phase.   \n- **Even MORE Nameplates arrived in the Shop,** so hop on the desktop app and check 'em out! We‚Äôre gonna need a bigger cabinet with how many Nameplates we‚Äôve got stacked! HAHAH!! Get it‚Ä¶ plates‚Ä¶ you stack them‚Ä¶ nameplates‚Ä¶ siigh‚Ä¶ \n\nSpeaking of stacks, our Engineering team shares a huge stack of fixes and improvements they‚Äôve made to Discord on a monthly basis. You‚Äôll always find ‚Äòem at [dis.gd/PatchNotes](http://dis.gd/PatchNotes).\n",

Thank you for your time. \n\n*‚Ä¶nah just kiddin‚Äô*, we‚Äôve got a TON of stuff to help make your time playing games, hanging out in voice, and generally doing whatever it is you do with your friends on Discord a whole lot better. \n\n<:CLController:1416095715096268864> Big Updates for Big Chillin' {improved}\n================\n\n- **User Profiles on desktop got a refreshed look!** They‚Äôve been updated to help show people more details about who you are, what you‚Äôre all about, and the games you‚Äôve been playing lately. And if you‚Äôre doing a LOT of stuff at once? Boy, do we have even *better* news for you: \n- **Playing games, listening to music, AND in a voice channel? Show ‚Äòem ALL off!** If you‚Äôre doing multiple things at once, they‚Äôll now all show as a stack of cards on your profile. \n- **On desktop, Activities can now be opened in a pop-out window.** Open your Watch Together session in a floating window while you speed through your DMs and servers. No one has ever had the technology to watch a video while doing something else on their PC. Until *now*. \n- **When you turn your device‚Äôs camera on, a sound now plays** to let you know that people can see your collection of Coke Zero cans, mechanical keyboards, or whatever the hell those ugly labu-things are. \n\nüõ†Ô∏è More Pins, A LOT More Server Members {improved}\n================\n\n- [In July](https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-july-7-2025), we **added support for AV1 video attachments and embeds**, and **sped up the loading of member lists for super-super-large servers**. Like, we‚Äôre talking about servers with MILLIONS of people. I can‚Äôt even count past 12, idk how these people do it. \n- [In August](https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-august-4-2025), we **increased the pin limit from 50 to 250** (also a big number) and **added proper embeds for Tumblr posts**. When sent in chat, you‚Äôll see fancy-looking descriptions for links to lots of different Tumblr content! It also shows the #tags used, such as #ball-pit. \n- [In September](https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-september-3-2025), our engineers became mad wizards and **increased the default server cap to 25M members**. Yes, 25 MILLION (*extremely* big number). \n\n<:CLServerBoost:1416095879449940029> Server Boosts and Boosts of Color  {improved}\n================\n\n- **Nitro‚Äôs newest color theme is‚Ä¶ whatever you want!** Use the power of ùì∞ùìªùì™ùì≠ùì≤ùìÆùì∑ùìΩùìº to help create your own [Custom Theme](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/207260127-How-to-Change-Discord-Color-Themes-and-Customize-Appearance-Settings#h_01JXZWY4ZQVKSDMSVG2RMJMFKF). Use up to FIVE different shades of colors to craft your ideal client theme or make some abhorrent mess of mismatched colors. It‚Äôll even sync with mobile! \n- **Spruce up your Server Tag with two new badge packs:** a Pet pack that includes lil‚Äô animals like cats, goats, and a SMAL BEASTE FROGGE, and a Flex pack that contains a sack filled with loadsamoney and a crown, making it fit for a king. Or a frog. \n\nEver seen those Group DM icons that are a bunch of your friends‚Äô avatars in a circle? Internally, we call those ‚Äúfacepiles.‚Äù And if you check out Patch Notes, over at [dis.gd/PatchNotes](https://dis.gd/PatchNotes), you may learn more tidbits like this! (And you‚Äôll see the hundreds of other things we fix, too.)\n\n",
